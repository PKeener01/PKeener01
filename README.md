- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrick
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and programming.  Also, I started running in Sept 2021 after completing a Spartan 21-k (yeah... I definitely should have started running first).  Oh! I also love games- board games, card games, computer games- you name it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning database management & design as part of my Master's in Data Science program.  I'd really like to learn more about MongoDB, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and parallel computing in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that fits in my schedule (5 hours per week) - I have been writing Python code for the better part of a decade and looking to give back to the community that helped me automate my 40 hr/wk job into a 20 hr/wk job.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: patrick.keener01@gmail.com

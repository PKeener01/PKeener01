- 👋 Hi, I’m Patrick
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and programming.  Also, I started running in Sept 2021 after completing a Spartan 21-k (yeah... I definitely should have started running first).  I also love games- board games, card games, computer games- you name it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning database management & design as part of my Master's in Data Science program.  I'd really like to learn more about MongoDB, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and parallel computing in general.
- 🌱 Professionally, I'm a consultant in the Big 4 consulting.  My specialty is credit risk modeling of debt portfolios which involves heavy use of statistics, economics, and programming (primarily in Python). My other responsibilities are in valuation which involves financial mathematics and programming. (and excel.  Oh my god, so much excel.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me build my portfolio for Machine Learning, MongoDB, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.  Happy to do code reviews on anything written in Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: patrick.keener01@gmail.com
